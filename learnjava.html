									<h2>What is Java?</h2>
									<p>Java is a widely-used, versatile, and object-oriented programming language. It was initially developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. Java is designed to be platform-independent, which means that code written in Java can run on various platforms without modification. This is achieved through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interprets and executes Java bytecode.</p>
                                    <p>Key features and aspects of Java include:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            <p><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, allowing developers to create and manipulate objects that encapsulate data and behavior.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java code is compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode. This bytecode is then interpreted by the JVM at runtime, allowing Java applications to run on any platform with a compatible JVM.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p><strong>Strongly Typed:</strong> Java is a statically typed language, which means that variable types must be declared explicitly and are checked at compile-time.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p><strong>Automatic Memory Management:</strong> Java includes a garbage collection system that automatically manages memory by reclaiming memory from objects that are no longer needed, thus reducing the risk of memory leaks.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p><strong>Robust and Secure:</strong> Java&apos;s design includes features like exception handling and strong type checking that help catch errors at an early stage, enhancing the robustness of applications. Java&apos;s security model also includes features that help protect against malicious code.</p>
                                        </li>

                                        <li>
                                            <p><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Java supports multithreading, allowing developers to create concurrent and parallel applications that can take advantage of modern multi-core processors.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p><strong>Networking:</strong> Java has built-in libraries for networking, making it relatively easy to develop applications that communicate over networks.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p><strong>Community and Ecosystem:</strong> Java has a large and active developer community, which has led to a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that simplify various aspects of development.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p><strong>Enterprise and Web Development:</strong> Java is commonly used in enterprise-level applications and web development. Technologies like JavaEE (now Jakarta EE) and Spring Framework provide tools for building robust and scalable applications.</p>

                                    <p><strong>1. Writing Your First Java Program:</strong>A Java program is typically written in a text editor and saved with a <code>.java</code> extension. Here&apos;s a simple &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program:</p>
                                    <pre><div><div><code>public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
    }
}</code></div></div></pre>
                                    <p>In this program:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><code>public class HelloWorld</code>: This declares a class named <code>HelloWorld</code>.</li>
                                        <li><code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>: This is the main method, the entry point of your program. It&apos;s where execution starts.</li>
                                        <li><code>System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);</code>: This line prints &quot;Hello, World!&quot; to the console.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>2. Variables and Data Types: </strong>Variables are used to store data. Java has various data types, including:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><code>int</code>: Integer numbers (e.g., <code>int age = 25;</code>)</li>
                                        <li><code>double</code>: Floating-point numbers (e.g., <code>double pi = 3.14159;</code>)</li>
                                        <li><code>boolean</code>: Boolean values (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>)</li>
                                        <li><code>char</code>: Single characters (e.g., <code>char grade = &apos;A&apos;;</code>)</li>
                                        <li><code>String</code>: Textual data (e.g., <code>String name = &quot;John&quot;;</code>)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>3. Operators:</strong>Java includes various operators for performing operations on variables and values:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Arithmetic operators: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code></li>
                                        <li>Comparison operators: <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code></li>
                                        <li>Logical operators: <code>&amp;&amp;</code> (AND), <code>||</code> (OR), <code>!</code> (NOT)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>4. Control Structures:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><code>if</code> statement: Used for conditional execution.</li>
                                        <li><code>while</code> loop: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.</li>
                                        <li><code>for</code> loop: Used for iterating over a range of values.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>5. Methods: </strong>Methods are blocks of code that can be reused. They take input, perform some tasks, and return output (or not). For example:</p>
                                    <pre><div><div><code>public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}</code></div></div></pre>
                                    <p><strong>6. Object-Oriented Concepts: </strong>Java is an object-oriented language. This means you work with objects that represent real-world entities. Key concepts include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Classes: Blueprint for creating objects.</li>
                                        <li>Objects: Instances of classes.</li>
                                        <li>Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing ones.</li>
                                        <li>Polymorphism: Using different classes through a common interface.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>7. Arrays:</strong>Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type. For example:</p>
                                    <pre><div><div><code>int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };</code></div></div></pre>
                                    <p><strong>8. Comments:</strong>Comments provide explanations in your code and are ignored by the compiler. There are two types:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Single-line comments: <code>// This is a comment</code></li>
                                        <li>Multi-line comments: <code>/* This is a multi-line comment */</code></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>9. Input/Output:</strong>You can read input from the user and display output using the <code>Scanner</code> class and&nbsp;<code>System.out</code>.</p>
                                    <pre><div><div><code>import java.util.Scanner;

public class InputOutputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;);
        String name = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;);
    }
}</code></div></div></pre>
                                    <p>These basics will give you a solid foundation to start programming in Java. As you progress, you can explore more advanced topics and build more complex applications.</p>
